🌌 The Significance of Structural Vital Force Theory

“In a structurally dynamic universe, energy and form are maintained not by material combustion, but by the rotational tension of structure itself.”

⸻

🔭 1. Background
	•	Modern physics largely relies on abstract force fields—gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum—but seldom explores whether structure itself can generate intrinsic vitality.
	•	Particle physics, rooted in the Standard Model, still treats particles as point-like, lacking a geometrical explanation for intrinsic properties like mass, spin, and quantized energy levels.
	•	Across cosmic scales, we observe spirals, rotations, and fractal symmetries; likewise in the micro world, orbital layers, quantum jumps, and interference suggest hidden geometric order.
	•	This hints at a possibility: structure is not passive—it may be the generative source of force and energy.

🧬 2. Core Assertions

The Structural Vital Force Theory proposes that:
	1.	Structure itself possesses internal tension, a form of “morpho-kinetic energy” independent of mass;
	2.	The triangular symmetry of spatial tension forms the most stable fundamental unit (inspired by the stability of triangles);
	3.	Rotational spiral structures can sustain tension fields through self-organization, expansion, and internal feedback;
	4.	Microscopic particles, macroscopic galaxies, and the universe as a whole may follow the same structural laws, merely at different scales;
	5.	Through frequency-synchronized scaling + structural symmetry angles, we may predict that sub-quark spiral levels exist beyond current particle resolution.
