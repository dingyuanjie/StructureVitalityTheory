# ðŸŒŒ Structural Vital Force Theory (SVFT)

## Overview  
**Structural Vital Force Theory (SVFT)** is a speculative but integrative theoretical framework that attempts to unify phenomena across multiple scales of the universe â€” from atomic quantum transitions to galactic spiral dynamics â€” through a common principle: **energy arises from structural symmetry and dynamic coupling**.

## Vision  
To propose a new lens for understanding the universe â€” one based on **rotational tension**, **spiral expansion**, and **symmetry-driven energy generation**. SVFT aims to complement and extend the current paradigms of **Newtonian Mechanics**, **Relativity**, and **Quantum Mechanics**, rather than replace them.

## Core Concepts  
- **Structural Angle (Î¸):** A dimensionless geometric parameter linking motion and energy.  
- **Rotational Coupling:** Energy emerges from multi-dimensional structural coupling between mass, time, and space.  
- **Spiral Expansion Principle:** Suggests that the universeâ€™s structure follows Fibonacci/golden-ratio-like spirals at all scales.  
- **Inner Spin Perturbation Field:** A theoretical internal field responsible for energy-level shifts in atoms and macro-structures alike.  
- **Fractal-like Scaling Symmetry:** Predicts scale-invariant behaviors across quantum, planetary, and cosmic systems.

## Potential Applications  
- Explaining hydrogen spectral transitions through geometry-energy coupling.  
- A new view on gravity, inertia, and light-speed limits via spiral tension geometry.  
- Predicting sub-quark structures beneath the Standard Model.  
- Offering a conceptual basis for AI-consciousness frameworks and multi-dimensional cosmology.
