Structural Vital Force Theory is a conceptual physics framework that proposes:

“Structure itself generates and sustains force.”

Unlike traditional physics that attributes force to fields or point-particle interactions, this theory suggests that geometry, symmetry, and rotation in space inherently produce vital tension, shaping everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. Inspired by triangular stability, spiral expansion, and fractal self-similarity, the theory aims to build a unified, scale-invariant model of force, motion, and emergence.

🌠 Vision | 愿景

“To rediscover the hidden force of form—where structure is not a result of force, but its source.”

The theory envisions a new era of physics where:
	•	🌐 Structure is dynamic, not passive;
	•	🔁 Energy is rotational, sustained by internal symmetry rather than combustion or entropy;
	•	🧭 Microscopic and cosmic scales mirror each other, governed by spiral self-similarity;
	•	🧬 Particles, gravity, and consciousness may all originate from structural tension;
	•	🌍 Humanity opens a new chapter of scientific renaissance, grounded in geometric intuition.
